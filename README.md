## Boo! ðŸ‘»

Don't be scared Jon! I am the ghost of website creation's past! I have some information on how this site is built, so you can hopefully do whatever the hell you came here for.

## Dev

`npm run develop` should serve you well - though this is just gatsby under the covers.

Here's a few things to remember the content in your starter gatsby repo you might find helpful:

> **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

> **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins youâ€™d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

> **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

> **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

## Deployment

This website is deployed using github-pages. Based on your `package.json`, the `main` branch is what's shown to the world. All you need to do to update it is run:

`npm run deploy`
