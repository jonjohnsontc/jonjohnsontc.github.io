I've been thinking about changing up my TLD from JonJ.io ever since it was announced that the .io domain would see a fun price hike in 2022 to $59.99 for renewals. Jon, Jonj, and jonjohnson.com are all taken, so it looks like I'm still going to pick a vanity TLD.
<br />

I went down the standard namecheap domain search k-hole, and ended up discovering that there are a few LGBT friendly domains, including .gay. C'mon, what's a more hilarious personal blog title than jons.gay? I'm not even gonna tell people where the dot is when I mention my blog title in person. They'll eventually figure it out.
<br />

One of the cool things about a .gay address, is that 20% of the proceeds from registrations go to different lgbt orgs, with over $148,000 having been donated so far.
<br />

So yeah, you can find me for a bit still on jonj.io, and also on jons.gay.
